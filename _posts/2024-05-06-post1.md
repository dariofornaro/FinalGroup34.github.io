Global warming has been a known threat for long time. It is common knowledge that urban areas are heating up. When in metropolitan areas building are built close together, they trap the heat, which leads to an increase of the surrounding temperatures.

Big metropolitan areas like Melbourne, which count a population of over 5 million people can become unbearable to live in. This is caused by a phenomenon known as the [ **Heat Island Effect**](https://www.epa.gov/heatislands), where urban areas have a saturation of heat and exhibit higher temperatures than surrounding areas. This is due to buildings, roads and other infrastructure absorbing more heat than natural bodies such as forests, for example in summer time walking barefeet on asphalt road will burn you while walking on grass will be fine. In heavily populated areas the hot air can find some difficulties to escape and temperature can boost up. Let's observe the graph of the mean temperature from year 1910 to 2022 in Olympic Park Melbourne.

Olympic Park Melbourne is an area in the inner city not surrounded by a lot of building. However, as you can see from the graph the temperature mean went up during the year. The reader might notice some bumps in the graph. An interesting one is the peak between 2000 and 2020. Those peaks where exactly registered in 2009 and 2014. [The January 2009](https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/resources/health-heatwave-south-eastern-australia-2009/) heatwave in Victoria was an event that entered history books because it was of an unprecedented intensity, as you might notice from the peak, and duration with maximum temperature of 15 celsius above average. 

Is there a solution to global warming? For sure there is and they have been largely discussed over and over but in the meantime the world keeps spinning and living in the center of a big city can become unsustainable. What is that make you relief from the sun? Where people can find refuge in extreme heat ?  Shadow, you will look for shadow. There have been many proven and successful studies suggesting that trees and other foliage promotes cooler environments through shade and evapotranspiration. This leads also [many other benefits](https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-trees-and-vegetation-reduce-heat-islands) such as less weight on the health system through reduction of heat related illnesses, improved air quality and reduced energy consumption. 



The City of Melbourne has understood the tree effects indeed it is aiming to increase its canopy cover to 40 per cent by 2040 by planting more than 3000 trees per year. What is the canopy percentage at the moment?
