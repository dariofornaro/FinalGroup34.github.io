With all that doom and gloom is there hope to mitigate some of these effects by creating more dense urban forests in Melbourne? Using the [Tree Canopy survey from 2021](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/tree-canopies-2021-urban-forest/information/?location=15,-37.79968,144.96604&basemap=mbs-7a7333) we are able to have a very accurate overview of Melbournes current state of foliage coverage in the inner suburbs of the city, each tree is surveyed for the area of canopy. This has allowed us to create a nice bar chart that shows the cumulative canopy area of the trees surveyed per suburb, to better normalise the data we have divided it by the total area of the **postcode** that it is in.

### Post codes, a quick rundown:
*A quick definition of a **postcode**: Melbourne is divided into suburbs, these have a unique name to them, then there are collections of suburbs under one **postcode**, some postcodes contain more suburbs than others.* 

We can see that the suburb with least amount of trees per its area by *square meters* is **3008** which is accurate as that area is known as the Docklands which is a new development containing a port. While on the opposite spectrum we can see the postcode **3052** which is North Melbourne/Parkville which contains many parks and the zoo and very intuitively many trees. 

### Soil sensors, a quick rundown:
*Before investigating the relationship between temperature and trees it would be wise to define the sensor data we have used to accumulate the temperature information. Melbourne has a comprehensive network of smart soil sensors. These sensors are more immune from the impact of random variables like a car window reflecting light at a sensor heating it up, or a car engine idling near a sensor compared to their atmospheric counterpart.*

Linking the two datasets together allows us to investigate whether it is true that trees reduce the average temperature in an urban environment. Looking at the two postcode extremes **3008** and **3052** the temperature values are quite close both almost 16 degrees celcius, however **3052** has significantly more trees, why is this? As with all environmental data there can be many variables to consider, however in this case the biggest one would be that **3008** is on a large water front, this means that it will in general experience [more wind and lower temperatures than the inland](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/16/12537) **3052**. Regardless as a testament to the theory, **3053** is an inland postcode next to **3052** and it contains less than half the canopy coverage than **3052** and has a much higher temperature average than **3052**. This means that the increased canopy coverage has similar effects to reduction of temperatures as a waterfront area! Finally, we will just bring our attention to the postcodes next to each other and inland in a belt, this would be **3000-3052** (the last 4 bars of the plot). Here we can clearly see a decreasing trend in temperature from the LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) line, while we have increasing tree canopy coverage. Fantastic, so YES tree canopy does reduce average temperature in urban environments - well, we should hold our horses here a little. Some things to consider before taking this as factual evidence, the sensor density might be higher in some postcodes than others and sensors might be placed in more favourable locations than others (they are microclimate sensitive). To be able to give a more concrete answer we would have to get many more sensors and spread them out evenly throughout our suburbs. However, for our preliminary analysis this gives us a good direction and indication that this is a possible direction for Melbourne to take to reduce the impacts of climate change.

# Can trees reduce the severity of weather events?

Reducing average temperatures is one thing, but stablising highly volatile weather events where temperatures can swing wildly is another important factor to investigate. Large swings in weather and temperature can lead a population to shorter lifespans, because [large fluctuations in temperature during summer boost the risk of death](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/summer-temperature-swings-linked-shorter-lifespan) in older people, very young and people with chronic diseases. To give people a fair chance at life in our changing climate once again **we must** look for solutions to reduce the severity of turbulent weather events. [Trees offer the possibility to offset this, and increase general human comfort](https://pure.manchester.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/54524206/FULL_TEXT.PDF). 

To see if this is working out in Melbourne we plot the average of the sensor data per postcode over two days during April. This way we can see if some postcodes see not only reductions in overall temperature but if the curves are less volatile giving us idication that shifts in weather will also be slowed down. Now that we know which postcodes are the most green, we will investigate **3052** and compare it to the fluctuation in **3006**. We can see that **3006** experience both higher temperatures but also a slightly larger spike with rising temperature, giving us maybe an insight that the area is less resistant to the changing temperature. I urge the reader to interact with the plot and see the relation of change in temperature and canopy area, to see if there some immunity to strong fluctuations. *It is to be noted* that due to the sparcity of some of the areas, it is not possible to make a definitive conclusion on this hypothesis when cumulatively comparing the sensors.

Therefore we will investigate through the power of *one more* visualisation by harnessing the beauty of geospatial data and maps! By doing so we can plot each sensor (that is at a 10-20cm depth) individually to visually demonstrate how temperatures can fluctuate more rapidly in localised areas with less tree canopy which is show as a heatmap. Drag the timeslider around on the map, this is moving the sensor data in thirty minute increments over a three month period from March to June, the more flickering that occurs in some areas will show more susceptibility to temperature change (which is bad!). 

To aid in the discussion I have marked *three notable areas* with red circles. Drawing attention to marker 1, which is in a high tree density area here we can see the changes to be more gradual and inline with general changing of the overall temperature. This in comparison to sensors located in marker 3 which is in a very urban area in the CBD with little trees experiences, flicker significantly more giving us some visual indication that it has less thermal buffering capacity, and therefor less resilience to more severe temperature fluctuations. It is also important to discuss outliers and external factors that may sway our visual analysis. Looking at marker 2, these sensors also flicker a lot more, and this is because they are on the famous Princes Bridge, and as discussed more being so close to an open body of water will lead to greater temperature changes due to evaporation and wind. So while looking at the sensors in a more localised and individual manner can give us greater insights it can be more prone to be impacted by local external variables that have to be considered.


To conclude, through our data driven journey of trying to uncover the power of trees in an urban environment we have managed to hopefully convince you as a reader that there is some indication that creating greater and more dense swathes of trees in urban environments can be a tool to help Melbournians secure a more certain future in times where uncertainty rings loudly. This also is not localised to Victoria or even Australia, this sort of evidence should be used to convince all people globally in a position to do so to act and put more funding into simple and cost effective solutions such as greenifying our concreted areas.
